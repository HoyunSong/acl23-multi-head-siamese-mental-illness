        "Hey guys, I hadn’t used my csl elite for 2-3 weeks, and today when I tried to turn it on it would not work. When I press the power button the light shows up red and the fans turn on but it doesn’t boot. I’ve attached a video. Has anyone come across this before? Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks",

        "It's my fears that is shaped into my sleeping consciousness and forces me to wake up and panic almost every night. I have nightmares ranging from school to family and other random fears. I'm not in school anymore, but I will be at some point next year or so, and I don't live with my family. Not sure what is triggering these nightmares. I hate that they cloud my mind when I wake up until I get distracted by other tasks. It's bothersome.",

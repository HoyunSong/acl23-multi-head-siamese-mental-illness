        "Hi everyone,  I previously made a post about talking to my family doc about anxiety and more increasingly frequent panic attacks. After talking with him about my situations and issues, (I've previously never talked with him about my anxiety before because I was able to manage but given the current state of things I believe it to be getting worse) He gave me an RX for Zoloft and VISTARIL (as needed), both of which I was somewhat familiar with but not to the extent I wish I would have been. After reading about both medications of success rate and side effects of both, I'm more nervous now about taking them, then not, (something I wish I would have said on the phone). I'm scared that I won't be able to drive my car or workout properly because of the drowsiness side effect that seems to become most people.  Even though I'm only 23 years old, I was more so open to the idea of being on alprazolam for a very short term basis (only taking .25 mg) as needed for the times I know I was going to experience a panic attack as I've taken this before (very carefully even without an actual rx) and it's worked well for me. I don't know if I should express this to my doctor or what I should do honestly but I don't know if I feel comfortable taking a full on SSRI after only a short 30 minute conversation about my increasing panic attacks.  What sucks is I have trouble (even thinking) about leaving the house without fear of having a panic at3tack, so I'm scared if I don't try them I'm going to have a panic attack behind the wheel of a car or in public and I'm not going to know what to do. I'm just kind of really upset and put off by the whole situation right now and I'm not really sure what the next steps I should take are.",
